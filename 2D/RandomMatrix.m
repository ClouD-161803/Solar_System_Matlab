% This function generates an n x m matrix of random numbers
% the nth row will hold in its 10 columns the same random number
% (so only different rows have different numbers)
% Claudio Vestini

% I wrote this function such that each generated background of stars
% is unique (there are n*n = n^2 possible backgrounds),
% but the background does not have to be generated at each iteration
% of drawing the new planet frames (e.g. there is one background 
% for every instance the "Run" button is pressed)
% My value for axisDimension will be 500

function matrix = RandomMatrix(n,m,axisDimensions)
% Preallocate array in computer memory
matrix = zeros(n,m);
% Generate matrix
for i = 1:n
    % This line generates a random number in range [-axisDimension,axisDimension]
    num = axisDimensions*(2*(rand()-1/2)); 
    matrix(i,:) = num(1);
