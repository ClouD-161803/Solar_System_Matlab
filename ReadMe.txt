This is my coding mini-project created over the MT22 break.
I have created first a 2D, and then a 3D animation of the solar system using real planetary data from NASA. 

The 2D main script allows the user to select the number of stars present in the background. This makes it so that every time the code is ran, a unique background is generated.

In the 3D version, the user is free to navigate the solar system whilst the code is running using the MatLab inbuilt tools at the top right of the figure window.
